This program was made for fun and a way to reinforce my skill i learn as i am only 2nd month stuyding in college as a software engineer.
It incorporates my favorite thing with a little code and I thought it would be enjoyable and a fun way to show off what i have learned so far.


If you want to use the ploting function you ned to istall matplotlib wich can be done a few ways by enter one of these commands on your terminal:

pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install matplotlib
py -m pip install matplotlib
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
