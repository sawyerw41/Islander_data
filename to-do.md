programs main function is done for the most part but I want to add some features to the program to give it more functionality and also make the design more firendly to people who dont know how to read python code

todo
- add comments to the functions
- be able to add other statistics becuase the file has an insane ammount of stat lines
- see if i can fix the errors that happen with some stats, I noticed that a lot of the stats tend to be a point off but i dont think thats something i have fix and the data is just a little off
- see if i can add general game stats which would change the entire start of the main as  where instead of asking you for what player you are searing for it will ask if you want stats about the team  or the player stats and run whatever you input
- find other ways to prevent errors or give user understandable error messages backs so that anyone could run the function.
- find stats that match between players
- add a plotter to see players stat histroy
